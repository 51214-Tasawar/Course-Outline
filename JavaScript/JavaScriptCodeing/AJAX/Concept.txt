      /////////////////////  AJAX  ////////////////////////
  AJAX: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used in web development to send
  and receive data from a server asynchronously without reloading the entire webpage. This makes web
  applications faster, more interactive, and responsive.

  Why Do We Use AJAX : 
   Before AJAX, websites used synchronous requests, meaning
   Every time the user requested new data, the entire webpage had to reload
   This was slow and inefficient, especially for dynamic websites like social media or dashboards.

  With AJAX, we can: Fetch data in the background without reloading the page
  Update specific parts of a webpage dynamically.
  Improve user experience by making web applications faster.
  Send data to the server without a full refresh.

  How Does AJAX Work: 
  AJAX works using the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object or Fetch API to communicate with the server asynchronously.

 AJAX Process: 
 User Action: A user clicks a button or enters data on a webpage
 JavaScript Creates a Request: The browser sends an asynchronous request to the server using JavaScript
 Server Processes the Request: The server retrieves or updates data in the database.
 Server Sends a Response: The server returns the requested data
 JavaScript Updates the Webpage: Without refreshing, JavaScript updates only the required part of the page.
